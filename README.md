# **Update History**

This readme will serve as the update history for this exercise. 
I'm hoping to complete everything I want within the 3-5 day time period.

The main goals that I want to accomplish for this are:

1. Showcase my skillset in a meaningful way
2. Use as much of the tech listed in the "Our Stack" section of the original readme

As I gain confidence with what I'm doing, these goals may change to include more items, but for now, they will serve as my starting point.

## **26 January 2017**

I wanted to start things off simple. Seeing as Botkit seems to have an extensive amount of documentation available for multiple platforms, I thought it would be best to start with a slack bot.

Rick and Morty is one of my favorite shows, so I figured a Mr. Meeseeks bot would be fun to work on. It's a very naive chat bot, but I plan to come back to make him a little more robust with the way he responds with what he 'hears'.

My next goal is to do something with Messenger, then finally move on to creating a bot via API.ai.

## **28 January 2017**

Decided to go the route of building out a front end with React today. Bot will most likely be made with API.ai. I decided to put the Messenger bot on the backburner, since it does not allow me to show any custom front-end work.

The following goals may include some assumptions based on what I was able to skim through on the API.ai site.

They may not be 100% accurate, but I want to have a set plan for myself first to make sure I stay on track.

Goals for this implementation:

1. Make chat bot ~~through API.ai~~ through recast.ai
  * Seems like API.ai no longer allows for free API access to domains without upgrading your account?
2. Allow user input and show output in React app
3. Make mobile responsive
