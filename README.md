# **Update History**

This readme will serve as the update history for this exercise. 
I'm hoping to complete everything I want within the 3-5 day time period.

The main goals that I want to accomplish for this are:
1. Showcase my skillset in a meaningful way
2. Use as much of the tech listed in the "Our Stack" section of the original readme

As I gain confidence with what I'm doing, these goals may change to include more items, but for now, they will serve as my starting point.

I wanted to start things off simple. Seeing as Botkit seems to have an extensive amount of documentation available for multiple platforms, I thought it would be best to start with a slack bot.

Rick and Morty is one of my favorite shows, so I figured a Mr. Meeseeks bot would be fun to work on. It's a very naive chat bot, but I plan to come back to make him a little more robust with the way he responds with what he 'hears'.

My next goal is to do something with Messenger, then finally move on to creating a bot via API.ai.
